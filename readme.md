# ScoliosisDetective

This program uses machine learning to determining and reporting a confidence percentage that a patient may possibly exhibit symptoms of scoliosis after examinaing a picture of their back. If the confidence percentage is greater than or equal to 50%, the program will additionally provide a recommendation to get an official consultation with a doctor as well as a link to a Google search of scoliosis treatment facilities. If the confidence is less than 50%, a recomendation for official consultation will not be provided; however, a link to treatment facilities will also be attached, in case the user still has concerns.

Of course, this program, in its current stage, in no way serves as an official/unofficial diagnosis for scoliosis. However, with more research and advanced code, it could potentially increase the efficiency of scoliosis treatment by providing a way for people to determine if exhibit symptoms of scoliosis at home rather than waiting for a regularly scheduled check-up with a doctor while the condition potentially worsens. Scoliosis is best treated when it is discovered early, so if people have an easier, more accessible way to determine if they have the symptoms, it could potentially lessen the rates of scoliosis surgery and other treatments for more extreme cases.
